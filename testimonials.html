His attention to detail, not only in his UI development but also in his efforts to excel at ancillary parts of development - becoming increasingly effective with tools, adhering to process best practices, and being a mentor to those around him - make him a pleasure to work with.  Gianni would be a valuable addition to any development team.<span class="fa-quote-right"></span><span class="author">-Adam M.</span></blockquote>
                        <blockquote cite="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-feola-104685b"><span class="fa-quote-left"></span>I've witnessed Gianni prove himself as a UI Developer by taking on a variety of different projects. If there's something he doesn't yet know how to do, you can be sure that he will take the time to research it and find out. He's also great at clearly explaining how a code works whenever I would ask him a question, as I'm trying to learn it myself. Gianni is hard-working, honest, and kind - and I'm proud to call him a colleague and a friend.<span class="fa-quote-right"></span><span class="author">-Anthony K.</span></blockquote>
